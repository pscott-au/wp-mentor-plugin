# wp-mentor-plugin

NB - work on this plugin has only recently commenced and it is far from production ready.

THis is a custom Wordpress plugin to facilitate the operation of a Mentoring program in which mentees and mentors can submit expressions of interest and a workflow manages them through to matching.

This work was commissioned by Sunshine Coast Chamber Alliance and is shared in the hope that others may find it useful.
